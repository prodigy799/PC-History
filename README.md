PC Active Window Tracker 
A lightweight AutoHotkey v2 script that logs the history of active applications on a Windows PC, including start time and estimated usage duration.

Features

Tracks the currently active window every few seconds.

Logs application title, window class, start time, and estimated usage (minutes).

Outputs data to a simple text file (AppHistory.txt) for later review.

Fully non-GUI, minimal resource usage.

Accurate timing using A_TickCount to avoid rounding issues with short durations.

Easy to run: requires only AutoHotkey v2.

Usage

Install AutoHotkey v2 from autohotkey.com
.

Save the script as PC_History.ahk.

Run the script; it will start logging your active apps automatically.

Press Ctrl + Esc to exit the script.

Output

Logs are written to AppHistory.txt in the same folder as the script.
